module Earl
  # A concurrency-safe registry of agents.
  #
  # - Agents of type `A` may (un)register from the registry at any time.
  # - Registered agents can be iterated with `#each`.
  # - Sent messages of type `M` are broadcasted to all registered agents.
  # - Failing to deliver a message to an agent will silently unregister it.
  #
  # ### Concurrency
  #
  # Relies on a copy-on-write array:
  # - (un)registering an agent will duplicate the current array (in a lock);
  # - iterations always iterate an immutable older reference to the array.
  #
  # This assumes that agents will (un)register themselves infrequently and
  # messages be sent much more often.
