    #
    # OPTIMIZE: if the next job is scheduled to run in 5 minutes, we could sleep
    #           for 300 seconds, but... what if the clock is adjusted? it will
    #           all depend on the internal implementation of `sleep`: does it
    #           wait for 300s no matter what? or until now+300s is reached? or
    #           is it using a monotonic clock (hence suspending the process will
    #           delay the sleep for the duration of the suspend)?
    #
    # TODO: we could allow sub-minute resolution by sleeping until the next time
    #       a job has to run, clamped to the end of the minute, it's a best
    #       effort (there is no guarantee), but better than the 1 minute
    #       resolution of CRON jobs.
