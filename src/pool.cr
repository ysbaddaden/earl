module Earl
  # Maintains a pool of worker agents of type `A` that will be spawned and
  # monitored.
  #
  # The pool will always be filled to its maximum capacity.
  #
  # ### Workers
  #
  # Crashed and unexpectedly stopped workers will be recycled and restarted,
  # until the pool is asked to stop.
  #
  # Worker agents can return as soon as possible when asked to stop, or keep
  # processing their mailbox until its empty.
  #
  # ### Mailbox
  #
  # Workers must include the `Mailbox(M)` module. Messages will be dispatched to
  # a single worker in an at-most-once manner.
  class Pool(A, M)
