module Earl
  # A singleton `Supervisor` accessible as `Earl.application` with additional
  # features suited for programs:
  #
  # - traps the SIGINT and SIGTERM signals to exit cleanly;
  # - adds an `at_exit` handler to ask supervised agents to stop gracefully.
  #
  # Programs must always start `Earl::Application`; some Earl agents (e.g. log
  # agents) expect that `Earl.application` will be started. It can be spawned
  # in the background (and forgotten) or better: be leveraged to monitor the
  # program's agents and block the main `Fiber` until the program is told to
  # terminate, which is recommended.
